# Hair-Product-Recommendations
Database Design Project

Description: The website is primarily targeted towards women, but anyone is welcome to use it. Its Purpose is to recommend hair products based on the information provided to it. The user would have the ability to input information about their hair type (natural, relaxed, transitioning,...) hair texture (straight, kinky, coily, curly), hair health condition (healthy, damaged, thinning… ), length (bob, mid, long), preferred style (slickback or out), and price range/budget, as well as being able to input their location. The purpose of the application is to assist users with finding hair products that are right for them, cheap, and nearby. 

My website solves the issue of having to go into a store and look through long shelves of products of many different companies, names, and ingredients. My website would be a helpful resource that would help users to save time and reduce the mental pressure of comparing pricing and products themselves.

The website is not meant to be a place where users can perform transactions, it's more so meant to create recommendations, for example, producing a list of products that a customer might want to use based on the data they entered.
